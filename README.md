## Documentation

### How to use this package ?

By default, this package supports Twig in these file extensions:

1. `.twig`
2. `.htm.twig`
3. `.html.twig`

Since a user can have more than one templating language package installed, this package doesn't support `.html` directly. To get highlighting for `.html` files with Twig code and all the other features this package provides, you can follow any of the two approaches given below 

1. Go to the bottom right status bar item that displays information on current syntax and click on that when the currently open file is any `.html` file. From there go to `Open all with current extensions as ...` and scroll to select `HTML (Twig)`. You should now be good to go.

2. When the currently open file is a `.twig` file, from the main menu, go to `Preferences -> Settings -- Syntax Specific`. This should open a 2 column new window, with the default settings on the right and a user settings on the left. In the user settings, add the following, save & close.

```json
{
    "extensions": [
        ".html"
    ]
}
```

### Key bindings

- The key bindings are configured so that pressing <kbd>shift + {</kbd> **twice** will automatically add spaces on both sides for the inner brace expression block & place the cursor in the center, like so `{{ | }}`.
- Similarly, pressing <kbd>shift + %</kbd> within `{}` will add spaces on both sides of the inner `%` like so `{% | %}`
- Use <kbd>ctrl + /</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl + shift + /</kbd> for Twig comments (`{# This is a Twig comment #}`)
- Use <kbd>#</kbd> within strings, to get the interpolation expression, like so `#{|}`.

### Auto completions
In order to get the auto completions, go to `Preferences: Settings` from the command palette and paste the following in the `Preferences.sublime-settings -- User` (the right hand window)

```json
"auto_complete_selector": "text.html.twig, meta.tag - punctuation.definition.tag.begin, source - comment - string.quoted.double.block - string.quoted.single.block - string.unquoted.heredoc",
"auto_complete_triggers":
[
    {"characters": "<", "selector": "text.html"},
    {"selector": "text.html.twig, text.html.basic"},
]
```

If you already have these in your user settings, then just copy the Twig related portions into them.

### Snippets

This package adds basic snippets for common code blocks. If you want more snippets, then please follow the official documentation on
